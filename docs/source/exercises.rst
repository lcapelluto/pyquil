Exercises
=========

Exercise 1: Quantum Dice
------------------------

Write a quantum program to simulate throwing an 8-sided die. The Python
function you should produce is:

::

    def throw_octahedral_die():
        # return the result of throwing an 8 sided die, an int between 1 and 8, by running a quantum program

Next, extend the program to work for any kind of fair die:

::

    def throw_polyhedral_die(num_sides):
        # return the result of throwing a num_sides sided die by running a quantum program

Exercise 2: Controlled Gates
----------------------------

We can use the full generality of NumPy to construct new gate matrices.

1. Write a function ``controlled`` which takes a :math:`2\times 2`
   matrix :math:`U` representing a single qubit operator, and makes a
   :math:`4\times 4` matrix which is a controlled variant of :math:`U`,
   with the first argument being the *control qubit*.

2. Write a Quil program to define a controlled-\ :math:`Y` gate in this
   manner. Find the wavefunction when applying this gate to qubit 1
   controlled by qubit 0.

Exercise 3: Grover's Algorithm
------------------------------

Write a quantum program for the single-shot Grover's algorithm. The
Python function you should produce is:

::

    # data is an array of 0's and 1's such that there are exactly three times as many
    # 0's as 1's
    def single_shot_grovers(data):
        # return an index that contains the value 1

As an example: ``single_shot_grovers([0,0,1,0])`` should return 2.

**HINT** - Remember that the Grover's diffusion operator is:

.. math::

   \begin{pmatrix}
   2/N - 1 & 2/N & \cdots & 2/N \\
   2/N &  & &\\
   \vdots & & \ddots & \\
   2/N & & & 2/N-1
   \end{pmatrix}


Exercise 4: Prisoner's Dilemma
------------------------------

A classic strategy game is the `prisoner's dilemma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma>`_ where two
prisoners get the minimal penalty if they collaborate and stay silent, get zero penalty if one of them defects and the
other collaborates (incurring maximum penalty) and get intermediate penalty if they both defect. This game has an
equilibrium where both defect and incur intermediate penalty.

However, things change dramatically when we allow for quantum strategies leading to the
`Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9806088>`_.

Can you design a program that simulates this game?
